**Key Considerations:
Flexibility: These estimates are guidelines. We should be prepared to adjust as we progress, based on the complexities we encounter.
Overlap and Parallel Work: Some tasks can overlap. For example, documentation (Sprint 5) can start earlier as features get finalized.
Feedback Integration: Time for integrating feedback during and after the beta testing phase (Sprint 7) is crucial. We should remain receptive to extending this phase if needed.
